### __About me__
I was brought to the IT sphere by the constant desire to improve in my work, the study of new technologies, the movement of career growth. I chose Frontend Development for the interesting implementation of projects that need to be in line with modern trends, technologies and interesting solutions. From personal qualities I can single out: purposefulness, composure, attentiveness, punctuality, responsibility. In any business, you always want to achieve perfectionism: to do everything with the highest quality, quickly and ahead of schedule. My hobby is tailoring and other interesting things. There hasn't been much time left for the hobby lately, but for me this is a great opportunity to switch and take a break from programming.
